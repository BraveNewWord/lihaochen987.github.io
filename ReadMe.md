# PURPOSE

A cool little website using monkeys, originally inspired by EK Peralta's artificially generated monkey project. 

## CURRENT PROGRESS

Sorted out most of the HTML + CSS, learning and working on Javascript to actually make the website do stuff. Gallery currently doesn't exist and probably will not exist for a while (after I've sorted out the JS stuff).
